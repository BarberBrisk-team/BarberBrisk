BarberBrisk is an Android application designed to streamline the process of booking appointments with barbers. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can browse through a list of barbers, view their available slots, and book an appointment at a convenient time.

In addition to booking appointments, BarberBrisk also allows users to rate and review their barbers. After each appointment, users receive a notification prompting them to rate their experience. These ratings are then visible to other users, helping them make informed decisions when choosing a barber.
